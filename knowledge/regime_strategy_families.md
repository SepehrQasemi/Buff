- trend_following: Trend continuation systems that favor directional persistence.
- breakout: Volatility expansion systems that trade range breaks without predicting direction.
- mean_reversion: Reversal systems that fade extremes back toward a reference level.
- market_making: Spread capture systems that provide liquidity in tight ranges.
- do_not_trade: Explicit no-trade mode used for fail-closed or extreme regimes.
