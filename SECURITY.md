# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues privately by opening a GitHub Security Advisory
or emailing the maintainer if an address is listed in the repository profile.

Do not open public issues for security-sensitive reports.

## Handling Secrets
- Do not commit secrets (API keys, tokens, private keys) to the repository.
- If a secret is accidentally committed, rotate it immediately and remove it
  from the repository history as needed.
