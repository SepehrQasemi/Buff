[![CI](https://github.com/Buff-Trading-AI/Buff/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Buff-Trading-AI/Buff/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Direction
Buff is evolving into a crypto futures R&D platform with:
- Mandatory online data ingestion
- Deterministic artifact-driven decision and analysis workflows
- Realistic paper-live futures simulation as the primary runtime mode
- Deferred execution connector scope until proven by shadow/reconciliation evidence
