# Buff
[![CI](https://github.com/Buff-Trading-AI/Buff/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Buff-Trading-AI/Buff/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Direction
Buff is evolving into a crypto futures R&D platform with:
- Mandatory online data ingestion
- Deterministic artifact-driven decision and analysis workflows
- Realistic paper-live futures simulation as the primary runtime mode
- Deferred execution connector scope until proven by shadow/reconciliation evidence

## Stage Source
Current stage is defined only in `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`.

## Development Docs
- Development path: `docs/MASTER_DEVELOPMENT_PATH.md`
- Canonical docs index: `docs/README.md`

## Invariants & Non-Goals
- Deterministic, artifact-first behavior is mandatory for comparable research outcomes.
- Non-goals include discretionary runtime drift, hidden mutable state, and unverifiable outputs.
- No prediction claims: Buff is an R&D and simulation platform, not a guaranteed forecasting engine.
