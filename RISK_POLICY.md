# RISK_POLICY

## Core Risk Rules (default v0.1)
- Risk per trade: 0.25%–0.5% of equity
- Daily max loss: 1% (kill-switch)
- Max trades/day: 3
- Mandatory SL/TP for any live order
- Leverage cap for early phases: 3x–5x (configurable; enforced)

## Risk Permission (news/event)
- green: normal
- yellow: reduce size / avoid new positions near major events
- red: no-trade

This layer is permission-only; it must not generate directional signals.
