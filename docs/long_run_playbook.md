# Long-Run Playbook (Deprecated Pointer)

Canonical source:
- [05_RUNBOOK_DEV_WORKFLOW.md](./05_RUNBOOK_DEV_WORKFLOW.md#long-run-harness)

Use these sections:
- [Long-Run Harness](./05_RUNBOOK_DEV_WORKFLOW.md#long-run-harness)
- [Troubleshooting Matrix](./05_RUNBOOK_DEV_WORKFLOW.md#troubleshooting-matrix)

Why this file is thin:
- PR3 merged long-run operational commands into the canonical runbook.

Historical note:
- The previous standalone playbook remains available in git history.
