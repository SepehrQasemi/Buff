# NOT AUTHORITATIVE — Compatibility Shim

Canonical documentation moved during the reset on 2026-02-24.
This file exists only for compatibility with legacy paths and automation checks.
Do not use this file to determine current stage, runtime behavior, or product direction.

## Canonical Redirect
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md`
- `docs/08_RESEARCH_LOOP.md`

## Contract Alignment
Strategy-pack expectations are defined by canonical contracts and research-loop promotion rules.
This shim exists only as a compatibility redirect.
