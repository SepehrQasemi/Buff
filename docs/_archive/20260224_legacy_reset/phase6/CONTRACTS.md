# Phase-6 Contracts

This document is intentionally thin after PR2 contract unification.

## Canonical Reference
- Error schema and code registry:
  [../03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md#canonical-error-schema](../03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md#canonical-error-schema)
- Artifact matrix:
  [../03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md#artifact-contract-matrix](../03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md#artifact-contract-matrix)

## Scope Notes
- Phase-6 run builder requirements remain deterministic and fail-closed.
- Data/storage/API shape details must be interpreted through the canonical contracts document.

## Historical Detailed Notes
Full pre-unification detail is preserved at:
- [../appendix/PHASE6_CONTRACTS_APPENDIX.md](../appendix/PHASE6_CONTRACTS_APPENDIX.md)
