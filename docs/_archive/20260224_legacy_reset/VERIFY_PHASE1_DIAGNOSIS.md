# VERIFY_PHASE1_DIAGNOSIS (Archived Pointer)

Canonical run/verify/recover guidance now lives in:
- [05_RUNBOOK_DEV_WORKFLOW.md](./05_RUNBOOK_DEV_WORKFLOW.md#troubleshooting-matrix)

Archived incident record:
- [docs/_archive/incidents/VERIFY_PHASE1_DIAGNOSIS.md](./_archive/incidents/VERIFY_PHASE1_DIAGNOSIS.md)

Why this file is thin:
- PR3 moved diagnosis notes to archive and kept one operational source in the runbook.
