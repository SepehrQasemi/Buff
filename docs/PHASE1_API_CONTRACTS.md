# Phase-1 Artifacts API Contracts (UI Core)

This document is intentionally thin after PR2 contract unification.

## Canonical Reference
- Error schema and code registry:
  [03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md#canonical-error-schema](./03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md#canonical-error-schema)
- Artifact matrix:
  [03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md#artifact-contract-matrix](./03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md#artifact-contract-matrix)

## Scope Notes
- Phase-1 remains deterministic, read-only, artifact-driven, and fail-closed.
- The stable workspace marker contract (`data-testid="chart-workspace"`) remains unchanged.

## Historical Detailed Notes
Full pre-unification endpoint/error detail is preserved at:
