# Artifacts (M1 / L1-L2)

This document is intentionally thin after PR2 contract unification.

## Canonical Reference
- Artifact matrix:
  [03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md#artifact-contract-matrix](./03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md#artifact-contract-matrix)
- Error schema and recovery model:
  [03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md#canonical-error-schema](./03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md#canonical-error-schema)

## Scope Notes
- Canonical run artifact requirements and optional artifacts are maintained in `docs/03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md`.
- Format precedence (parquet vs JSONL) and panel/report usage are documented there to avoid drift.

## Historical Detailed Notes
Full pre-unification artifact details are preserved at:
- [appendix/ARTIFACTS_APPENDIX.md](./appendix/ARTIFACTS_APPENDIX.md)
