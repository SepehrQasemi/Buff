# NOT AUTHORITATIVE — Compatibility Shim

Canonical documentation moved during the reset on 2026-02-24.
This file exists only for compatibility with legacy paths and automation checks.
Do not use this file to determine current stage, runtime behavior, or product direction.

## Canonical Redirect
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/02_ARCHITECTURE_BOUNDARIES.md`
- `docs/03_CONTRACTS_AND_SCHEMAS.md`
- `docs/07_PAPER_LIVE_FUTURES.md`

## Runtime Contract Alignment
UI behavior must reflect canonical artifacts and contracts defined in active docs.
This file is a redirect shim and not a product authority source.
