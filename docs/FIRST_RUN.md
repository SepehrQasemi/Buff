# First Run (Deprecated Pointer)

Canonical source:
- [05_RUNBOOK_DEV_WORKFLOW.md](./05_RUNBOOK_DEV_WORKFLOW.md)

Use these sections:
- [Quickstart](./05_RUNBOOK_DEV_WORKFLOW.md#quickstart)
- [Service Lifecycle](./05_RUNBOOK_DEV_WORKFLOW.md#service-lifecycle)
- [Export Report Workflow](./05_RUNBOOK_DEV_WORKFLOW.md#export-report-workflow)
- [Troubleshooting Matrix](./05_RUNBOOK_DEV_WORKFLOW.md#troubleshooting-matrix)

Why this file is thin:
- PR3 consolidated run/verify/recover instructions into one authoritative runbook.
- Keeping one command source prevents drift between startup, verification, and recovery steps.

Historical note:
- This file previously contained a full first-run walkthrough and troubleshooting details.
